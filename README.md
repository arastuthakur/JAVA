**Advanced Java**

**1. Learn JDBC**

JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity, which is a standard Java API for database-independent connectivity between the Java programming language and a wide range of databases.
By learning JDBC, you will be able to connect your Java project to an underlying database.

**2. Learn Servlets**

Java servlets are Java classes that are designed to respond to HTTP requests in the context of a Web application.
By learning Servlet, you will be able to understand how to process the HTTP request, how to return HTTP response, how to build a web page, etc.

**3. Learn JPA**

The Java Persistence API (JPA) is the Java standard for mapping Java objects to a relational database. Mapping Java objects to database tables and vice versa is called Object-relational mapping (ORM).
By learning JPA, you will be able to map Java class into the database table directly (using ORM).

**4. Learn JAX-RS**

JAX-RS is Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS) is a Java programming language API spec that provides support in creating web services according to the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural pattern.
There are two main implementations of JAX-RS API:
1. Jersey Framework
2. RESTEasy
By learning JAX-RS and its implementations, you will be able to develop RESTFul web services in Java.

**5. Learn Design Patterns**

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.
By learning Design patterns, you will be able to apply commonly used design patterns in real-time project development to solve a particular problem.

**6. Learn Thymeleaf**

Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine for both web and standalone environments, capable of processing HTML, XML, JavaScript, CSS, and even plain text.
By learning the Thymeleaf template, you will be able to build dynamic HTML web pages in Spring MVC projects.

**Build Tools**

Maven
Maven is a popular build and dependency management tool in Java.
Gradle
Gradle is an open-source build automation tool that is designed to be flexible enough to build almost any type of software

By learning Maven or Gradle, you will be able to build Java projects as WAR, JAR, or EAR.

**Spring Framework**

**Learn Spring Core**

Learn Spring core fundamentals such as:
Dependency injection
Spring IOC
Spring beans
Spring bean life cycle
Spring configuration styles (XML, Java-based, and annotation-based) 

**Learn important annotations**

By learning Spring core, you will be able to understand how to use DI, IOC, Spring beans in Spring-based applications.

**Learn Spring Security**

Spring Security is a framework that provides authentication, authorization, and protection against common attacks. 
Also, learn JWT for token-based authentication.
By Learning Spring security, you will be able to secure web applications as well as REST APIs.

**Learn Spring Data JPA**

The goal of the Spring Data JPA module is to significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to implement data access layers for various persistence stores.
By learning Spring Data JPA, you will be able to develop a repository/DAO layer without writing boilerplate code.

**Learn Spring MVC**

Spring MVC is a web MVC framework for building web applications as well as RESTful web services.
By learning Spring MVC, you will be able to develop web applications as well as RESTful web services.

**Learn Spring Boot**

Spring Boot is basically an extension of the Spring framework which eliminated the boilerplate configurations required for setting up a Spring application.
By learning Spring Boot, you will be able to develop REST APIs, web applications, and Microservices.
**Hibernate Framework**

Learn and master Hibernate framework at Hibernate ORM Framework

**Essential skills**

**Git**

Learn Git as a version control system for your projects.

**SQL**

Learn SQL to query the relational databases.

**Databases**

As a Java programmer, you should have good knowledge of databases.

Here are the commonly used relational databases and No SQL databases:

RDBMS
MySQL
PostgreSQL
MS-SQL server
Oracle
No SQL Databases
MongoDB
Cassandra

**Testing Java Application**

Check out the JUnit framework and Mokito for unit testing in Java. As a Java programmer, you should have good knowledge of testing your core logic using the JUnit framework.

**Commonly used libraries for Java development**

It's also important for Java programmers to learn commonly used utility libraries for Java development.

- Parsing libraries - Jackson, GSON
- Logging libraries - Log4j
- Apache Commons - Lang, IO
